# Tachles — Project Handoff Document

*Last updated: end of Day 7 of the private beta build.*

This document captures everything an agent (Claude Code, future me, or a human developer) needs to know to pick up where the project currently stands. Read this in full before touching anything.

---

## 1. Quick orientation

**Project:** Tachles — a tool that translates Hebrew letters from Israeli institutions (Bituach Leumi, banks, municipalities, lawyers) into plain Hebrew and English.

**Current phase:** Private beta build. 10-day plan; days 1-2 are complete and deployed. Days 3-10 remain.

**Project owner:** Avraham (abebutel@gmail.com). Israeli, building this solo. English-speaking, Hebrew-fluent.

**Project lives at:** `C:\aiProjectIdeas\Claude\tachles` on Avraham's machine. GitHub: `https://github.com/abebutel/tachles`. Vercel project linked.

**Domain:** `tachles.help` (purchased, added to Vercel project, DNS configured).

**Current deploy status:** Working end-to-end locally on `http://localhost:3000`. Vercel deploy active with env vars configured. Local sign-in flow (Google + email magic link) works; invite-only enforcement works; beta consent flow works; protected dashboard works.

---

## 2. Reading list — read these first, in this order

Each of these is in the same outputs folder as this handoff:

1. **`privacy-en.md`** and **`privacy-he.md`** — the privacy policy, beta version. The promises in here are the contract with users. Every architectural decision must uphold these.
2. **`subprocessors-en.md`** and **`subprocessors-he.md`** — the list of named third-party providers, with status (active in beta vs deferred to public launch).
3. **`no-log-proxy-spec.md`** — the engineering spec for the document-processing pipeline. This is the architectural backbone of the product. Days 3-7 build out what's specced here. Read it carefully.
4. **`build-plan-beta.md`** — the active 10-day plan. Days 1-2 are done. Days 3-10 are the next sessions.
5. **`build-plan-v1.md`** — the public-launch plan (deferred). Reference for "what gets re-added when the beta graduates."
6. **`CLAUDE.md`** *(in Avraham's uploads, not this folder)* — the original product strategy document that bootstrapped the project. Useful for the "why" behind some decisions and for context on the wider product family (Tachles is one of four planned products).

After reading those, read the codebase: start at `app/[locale]/page.tsx`, then `middleware.ts`, then `app/auth/callback/route.ts`, then the auth flow pages.

---

## 3. The product in one paragraph

A user uploads a photo of a Hebrew letter (from Bituach Leumi, a bank, a municipality, or a lawyer). The app OCRs the image, classifies the document type, sends the text through an LLM with a specialist prompt that produces a plain-language Hebrew + English summary including deadlines and required actions. Results are shown in a clear card with deadlines highlighted. History is stored locally in the user's browser via IndexedDB — never on the server. The product is invite-only during beta and will be ₪29/month at public launch.

---

## 4. Avraham's values and reservations (the most important context)

These shaped every architectural decision. The next agent must understand and respect them.

**4a. PII handling is the central concern.** Avraham was anxious about handling Israelis' PII — Teudat Zehut, bank details, addresses on government letters. He didn't want a product where a breach would be career-ending. This drove the move away from the original MVP (which would have stored documents in Supabase Storage for 90 days) toward a **no-log streaming proxy** architecture where documents pass through the server in memory only and are never persisted, logged, or sent to error trackers. The architecture is real, not marketing — engineering discipline enforces it via ESLint rules, a CI canary test, and an external audit (deferred for beta).

**4b. Honest marketing, even at the cost of better-sounding copy.** I (the previous assistant) suggested an "Architecture 1" where the browser called the LLM directly, bypassing our servers. Technically clean, but it would create an *impression* with users that "their data never leaves their device" — which would be misleading because the data still goes to Anthropic/Google. Avraham rejected this approach explicitly, saying "I want to always be upfront & honest — even if in the end it'll mean putting this aside and trying to think of something else." Take this seriously. Every privacy claim in marketing and the policy must be *literally* true to an average user, not just technically true. The current privacy copy went through several rewrites to achieve this.

**4c. Budget-conscious.** Avraham did not budget for the external security audit (~$5-7K). This is what pivoted us from a public-launch plan to a private-beta scope. The private beta defers four expensive things: external audit, cyber liability insurance, attorney TOS review, and Israeli company registration. Total beta operating cost: ~$5-30/month, ~$30 in startup costs (domain). Don't suggest expensive solutions without flagging cost.

**4d. Honesty + caution about cost extends to ongoing decisions.** Avraham asked about monthly cost as well as setup cost. A useful lens for every decision: "what's the one-time cost? what's the ongoing cost?"

**4e. Subprocessors named separately, not in the main policy.** Per Avraham's request, the privacy policy describes third parties by category ("AI language model provider", "payment processor") and the named companies live on a separate subprocessors page. Legal under GDPR + Israeli law. Lets the stack change without rewriting the policy.

## 5. Key decisions made

| Decision | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Product name | **Tachles** (תכלס) | Avraham's pick from a shortlist. Israeli slang meaning "bottom line / cut to the chase" — exactly the value prop. |
| Domain | `tachles.help` | Purchased, in Vercel. |
| Geographic scope | Israel (Hebrew + English) | Per CLAUDE.md and Avraham's audience. |
| LLM (translation) | Anthropic Claude (`claude-sonnet-4-20250514` per CLAUDE.md, but use whatever's current) | Strong Hebrew, strong privacy posture. |
| OCR | Google Cloud Vision **primary**, Claude Vision **fallback** | Avraham's call. Google has better Hebrew OCR; Claude is fallback below 0.75 confidence threshold (tunable via env var). |
| LLM safety | Configured for zero training on submitted data via API tier. | Confirmed in subprocessors page DPA notes. |
| Architecture | No-log streaming proxy (Architecture B) | Servers never persist user content. See `no-log-proxy-spec.md`. |
| History | **Client-side IndexedDB** (free tier) + **encrypted cross-device sync** with Argon2id (paid tier, deferred to public launch) | Privacy posture is the differentiator. |
| Hosting | Vercel + Supabase (EU/Frankfurt) | Privacy-aligned region. |
| Auth providers | Google OAuth + email magic link | Apple deferred until public launch (avoids $99/yr Apple Developer cost). |
| Analytics | Plausible (cookieless, EU-hosted) — **deferred to public launch** | Beta is too small to need analytics; talk directly to the 20 users. |
| Payment | Stripe (deferred to public launch — no billing in beta) | Beta is free. |

Decisions explicitly rejected:

- Architecture 1 (browser-direct LLM calls) — would create misleading "we don't touch your data" impression.
- Architecture 2 (generic explainer pivot) — Avraham didn't think users would pay for this.
- 90-day server-side storage (the original CLAUDE.md plan) — increases breach blast radius unnecessarily.

## 6. What's built (Days 1-2 complete)

### Day 1 — Foundation

- Next.js 16 + TypeScript + Tailwind + App Router scaffold at `C:\aiProjectIdeas\Claude\tachles`
- `next-intl@4.12` configured for Hebrew/English with `localePrefix: "always"` and `defaultLocale: "he"`
- RTL handling in layout based on locale
- `messages/en.json` and `messages/he.json` translation files
- `i18n/{routing,navigation,request}.ts` — locale config
- `middleware.ts` combining i18n + Supabase session refresh (updated on day 2)
- Home page at `app/[locale]/page.tsx` with "Tachles" branding + sign-in CTA + language toggle
- GitHub repo `abebutel/tachles` on `main`, all commits pushed
- Vercel project linked to GitHub, auto-deploys on push, env vars configured
- `.env.example` template, `.env.local` with real keys (gitignored)

### Day 2 — Auth, profiles, beta consent

- Supabase project provisioned in EU (Frankfurt)
- SQL migration `supabase/migrations/0001_init.sql` applied:
  - `profiles` table (extends `auth.users` with `beta_consent_version`, `beta_consent_accepted_at`, `preferred_language`)
  - `beta_invites` table (allowlist)
  - `handle_new_user()` trigger: creates profile only if email is on invite list; updates `used_at` on the invite
  - `set_updated_at()` trigger on profiles
  - Row Level Security policies (users can read/update own profile; `beta_invites` has no policies = service-role only)
- Supabase clients:
  - `lib/supabase/client.ts` — browser
  - `lib/supabase/server.ts` — server (async, uses Next.js cookies)
  - `lib/supabase/admin.ts` — service-role (bypasses RLS, server-only)
- Auth flow:
  - `app/[locale]/sign-in/page.tsx` — Google button + email magic link form
  - `app/[locale]/sign-in/actions.ts` — server action that checks invite list before sending magic link
  - `app/auth/callback/route.ts` — OAuth + magic link callback handler; checks profile, redirects to onboarding / dashboard / not-invited
  - `app/[locale]/onboarding/page.tsx` + `form.tsx` + `actions.ts` — beta consent screen, captures version + timestamp
  - `app/[locale]/not-invited/page.tsx` — friendly invite-only message
  - `app/[locale]/dashboard/page.tsx` — protected placeholder
  - `components/sign-out-button.tsx`
- TypeScript types at `types/database.ts`
- Vercel env vars set: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, `BETA_CONSENT_VERSION`
- Google OAuth client configured in Google Cloud Console; client ID + secret in Supabase
- Supabase Redirect URLs allowlist includes localhost, Vercel preview, and `tachles.help`
- All four test cases pass: invited Google flow, invited magic link flow, non-invited magic link (rejected), non-invited Google (lands on not-invited page)

### Day 3 — Proxy infrastructure

- `lib/proxy/proxy-logger.ts` — typed `proxyLogger` with allow-listed `LoggableField` union; adding a field requires a `// log-field-added: <reason>` comment per spec
- `lib/proxy/safe-error.ts` — `SafeError` class + `SafeErrorCodes` constants
- `lib/proxy/sentry-before-send.ts` — Sentry scrubber that strips request data, cookies, headers, breadcrumbs, and all `extra`/`contexts` outside a tiny allow-list
- Three custom ESLint rules in `eslint-rules/` exposed as the local `tachles` plugin:
  - `no-body-logging` — flags body-like fields passed to known loggers; unwraps TS type assertions so `as never` casts don't bypass it
  - `no-console-in-proxy` — bans `console.*` in proxy directories
  - `no-text-on-request` — bans `request.text/json/arrayBuffer/formData/blob`; `lib/proxy/translate-pipeline.ts` is whitelisted per Six Disciplines #2
- Rules scoped to `lib/proxy/**`, `app/api/{ocr,translate,sync}/**` in `eslint.config.mjs`
- ~~Sentry installed (`@sentry/nextjs`); `sentry.{server,edge,client}.config.ts` + `instrumentation.ts`; `beforeSend` hook wired~~ — **rolled back during Day 4.** Sentry's Node SDK transitively imports `node:fs` and `node:path`, which Next 16 bundles into the Edge middleware and Vercel rejects at deploy time. The auto-loading instrumentation + Sentry SDK dep were removed. `lib/proxy/sentry-before-send.ts` (the scrubber function with its own local ScrubbableEvent type) is preserved for when we wire Sentry properly via `withSentryConfig()` in `next.config.ts` post-launch
- husky + lint-staged installed; `.husky/pre-commit` runs `lint-staged` which runs `eslint --fix` and `scripts/check-proxy-disk-writes.mjs` on staged files
- `scripts/check-proxy-disk-writes.mjs` — pre-commit scanner for `fs.write*` / `createWriteStream` / `os.tmpdir` / `/tmp/` / `axios|got|node-fetch` imports in proxy paths; override via `// proxy-disk-write-approved: <reason>`
- CI canary test scaffold at `tests/canary/tracer.test.ts` (vitest) — captures stdout/stderr, runs a proxy stub with a `__TRACER_<uuid>__` string, asserts the tracer never appears in any captured output. Three tests pass; harness self-test included. Gets teeth on Day 4 when `/api/ocr` exists
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — runs `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test:canary`, and the pre-commit scanner across all tracked proxy files on every push and PR
- `.npmrc` — `verify-deps-before-run=false` to keep `pnpm <script>` from auto-reinstalling on every invocation; `ignored-built-dependencies[]=@sentry/cli` to silence the pnpm v11 build-script prompt
- `package.json` `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies` allowlist for `@parcel/watcher`, `@swc/core`, `sharp`, `unrs-resolver`
- All checks green: `pnpm lint` (0 errors), `pnpm test:canary` (3 passing), `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` (clean)

### Day 4 — `/api/ocr`

- `lib/proxy/auth.ts` — `verifyRequestAuth(request)` validates the `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` header via `supabase.auth.getUser(token)`. The spec's "local JWT verification" alternative is documented inline; rejected for beta because the ~100ms upstream cost is negligible next to OCR latency and avoids wiring `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`
- `lib/proxy/ratelimit.ts` — Upstash sliding-window limiter: 30 req/h per user (free tier), 200 req/h per user (paid, deferred), 10 req/min per IP. Lazy singleton; throws `SafeError` if env not configured. `enforceRateLimit()` convenience helper for routes
- `lib/proxy/stream.ts` — `readBodyBounded(request, maxBytes)` reads `request.body` chunk-by-chunk and enforces the size limit DURING the read (not just via `Content-Length`); `bytesToBase64()` chunked encoder avoids stack overflow on large buffers
- `lib/proxy/ocr-client.ts` — Two-provider OCR:
  - **Primary:** Google Cloud Vision `DOCUMENT_TEXT_DETECTION` via REST API (Edge-compatible, no Node SDK). Uses `GOOGLE_CLOUD_VISION_KEY` as a plain API key with API restriction set to Vision only — simpler than service-account JWT signing on Edge. Confidence = mean of page confidences
  - **Fallback:** Anthropic `claude-haiku-4-5` vision via direct REST `fetch()` (NOT the `@anthropic-ai/sdk` — see Day 4 followup history below). Triggered when Google confidence < `OCR_FALLBACK_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` (default 0.75) or Google throws. Confidence reported as 1.0 since Claude doesn't return a calibrated score
  - `runOcr()` orchestrates; rejects unsupported media types (415); surfaces upstream errors as `SafeError` with stable codes
- `app/api/ocr/route.ts` — Edge runtime POST handler. Order of operations: auth → rate-limit → `Content-Length` check (10 MB cap via `MAX_OCR_BODY_BYTES`) → bounded body read → OCR → JSON response. Logs ONLY: `ts, user_id, request_id, route, image_size_bytes, response_status, ocr_provider_used, ocr_confidence, latency_ms` — no bytes, no extracted text. Errors logged with `error_code` + `upstream` only
- ESLint rule refined: `no-text-on-request` now fires only when the receiver is named `request` or `req` (the conventional Next.js parameter). Previous version was too aggressive — fired on `res.json()` against Google Vision's metadata wrapper, which is legitimate upstream-response parsing. Doc comment in the rule explains the heuristic limit
- Tests at `tests/canary/ocr.test.ts` (vitest, mocked auth/ratelimit/runOcr) — sends a `__TRACER_<uuid>__` in the request body AND in the mocked OCR result; asserts the tracer surfaces in the response (correctness) but never in stdout/stderr/proxyLogger payloads (privacy). Also covers the rate-limited error path
- Tests at `tests/unit/stream.test.ts` — bounded reader: happy path, declared Content-Length over limit (early reject), mid-read size overflow (chunked rejection), invalid Content-Length, large-buffer base64 round-trip
- Tests at `tests/unit/ocr-client.test.ts` — Google Vision happy path (Hebrew text), 500 error → UPSTREAM_5XX, 429 → UPSTREAM_RATE_LIMIT, missing API key → OCR_NOT_CONFIGURED, fallback to Claude when confidence below threshold, Google used when confidence above, unsupported media type rejected before any upstream call
- `vitest.config.ts` — aliases `@/` to project root so tests can use the same import paths as the app
- CI workflow extended: `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` + `pnpm test:unit` added alongside the existing `pnpm lint` + `pnpm test:canary`
- 18/18 tests passing, lint clean, TS clean
- **Deferred to a follow-up commit:** the 20-synthetic-Hebrew-letter accuracy run + threshold tuning. Requires real GCP / Anthropic / Upstash keys; default threshold 0.75 from the spec is sensible until we have real data
- **Day 4 followup commits (post-merge debugging):** Vercel preview deploys failed three times before the PR could ship. Each failure taught us something about Edge runtime bundling:
  - **Followup 1:** `proxyLogger` used `process.stdout.write` / `process.stderr.write`, which aren't available in Edge runtime. Switched to `console.log`/`warn`/`error` and added a per-file ESLint override in `eslint.config.mjs` so the no-console-in-proxy rule doesn't ban its own escape hatch. Updated the Day 3 canary test to spy on `console.*` instead of monkey-patching process streams (vitest intercepts `console.*` before it reaches the streams)
  - **Followup 2:** the auto-loading Sentry stack from Day 3 (`instrumentation.ts` + `sentry.{server,edge,client}.config.ts`) was pulling `@sentry/nextjs` into the Edge middleware bundle, and Sentry's Node SDK uses `node:fs`/`node:path` transitively. **Rolled Sentry back entirely:** uninstalled the SDK, deleted the config files, rewrote `lib/proxy/sentry-before-send.ts` to use a local `ScrubbableEvent` interface with zero dependency on `@sentry/nextjs`. The scrubber stays in-tree as the spec-required implementation, ready to wire post-launch via `withSentryConfig()` in `next.config.ts` (the supported Edge-aware integration path). For the beta we don't have a `SENTRY_DSN` configured anyway, so the previous wiring was a no-op at runtime
  - **Followup 3:** renamed `middleware.ts` → `proxy.ts` per Next 16's deprecation warning. Exported function went from `middleware` to `proxy`. Didn't fix the Edge error on its own
  - **Followup 4:** **the actual root cause.** `@anthropic-ai/sdk` v0.96.0 ships a credential loader at `core/credentials.mjs` and `lib/credentials/*.mjs` with static `await import("node:fs")` / `await import("node:path")` calls (for OAuth disk credentials). Even though we only ever pass `apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and never reach the disk-loading code path, Vercel's Edge function scanner rejects on import-graph reachability. Vercel was reporting "_middleware" referencing unsupported modules, but the actual offender was `/api/ocr` (also Edge runtime) which imports `@anthropic-ai/sdk` — Vercel bundles all Edge functions in a shared scan unit and reports the alphabetically-first offender. **Fix:** replaced the SDK with a direct `fetch()` to `https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages` (same style we already use for Google Vision REST). Uninstalled the SDK dep. Updated the unit test to mock by URL routing instead of mocking the SDK module. This is the pattern Day 5's `lib/proxy/anthropic-client.ts` reuses.

### Day 5 — `/api/translate` (classification + specialists, sans quality check)

- `lib/prompts/types.ts` — typed JSON shapes returned by every prompt: `ClassificationResult` (institution_category + confidence + detected_signals), `TranslationResult` (tldr_he/en, institution, document_type, reference_numbers, amounts, dates, action_items, translation_he/en), `TranslateResponse` (the wrapper /api/translate returns)
- `lib/prompts/classify.ts` — `buildPrompt_ClassifyDocument(ocrText)`. System prompt lists the 4 institution categories with their identifying signals; returns JSON with category + 0-1 confidence + brief detected_signals array
- `lib/prompts/shared.ts` — `OUTPUT_SHAPE_SPEC` constant used by all 4 specialists + the generic fallback. Encodes the JSON contract: empty arrays for missing sections, ISO dates when unambiguous, exact amounts, "friend explaining over coffee" tone, no fabrication
- `lib/prompts/bituach-leumi.ts` — Bituach Leumi specialist. Calls out claim file numbers (תיק), eligibility decisions (זכאי/לא זכאי), appeals deadlines, repayment demands as high-urgency action items
- `lib/prompts/bank.ts` — Bank/credit-card specialist. **Masks account numbers** in tldr/translation/reference_numbers (last 4 digits visible, earlier digits as bullets) — privacy hardening so screenshots of translations don't echo full account numbers. Handles statements, overdraft warnings, mortgage statements, fraud alerts
- `lib/prompts/municipality.ts` — עירייה/מועצה specialist. ארנונה bills, water bills, parking fines, betterment levies, planning-committee decisions. Surfaces objection-filing deadlines and exemption-eligibility info
- `lib/prompts/lawyer.ts` — legal notices. **Mandates a high-urgency disclaimer as the FIRST action_item** ("מומלץ להתייעץ עם עורך דין... תרגום זה אינו ייעוץ משפטי" / "Consider consulting a lawyer... This translation is not legal advice") for every lawyer-letter output. Doesn't sugar-coat or catastrophize — just translates clearly
- `lib/prompts/generic.ts` — `buildPrompt_TranslateDocument(ocrText)`. Fallback when the classifier returns "unknown" or its confidence is below `SPECIALIST_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` (default 0.6, env-tunable). Generic-best-practices framing
- `lib/prompts/route.ts` — `routeToSpecialistPrompt(ocrText, classification)` picks the right specialist based on the classifier's category and confidence. Returns `{ route, prompt }`
- `lib/proxy/anthropic-client.ts` — fetch-based wrapper around `https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages`. Two functions:
  - `callAnthropicMessages(body)` — single non-retried call, returns text + token usage. Throws `SafeError` on HTTP error or empty response
  - `callAnthropicJson<T>(body)` — wraps the messages call with JSON parsing + retry. Strips ` ```json ` fences; if parse fails, retries once with a corrective reminder; on second failure throws `UPSTREAM_INVALID_RESPONSE`. Sums token usage across both calls
- `lib/proxy/translate-pipeline.ts` — **THE ONE FILE allowed to call `request.json()`** (Six Disciplines #2; ESLint exemption in eslint.config.mjs was already in place from Day 3). `runTranslationPipeline(request)`:
  1. Pre-flight `Content-Length` size check (cap via `MAX_TRANSLATE_BODY_BYTES`, default 50 KB)
  2. `request.json()` — parses the inbound `{ ocr_text, target_language? }` envelope. Tight validation
  3. Classification call (Anthropic, low max_tokens)
  4. `normalizeClassification` — defensive shape check on the model's JSON
  5. Routing — picks specialist via `routeToSpecialistPrompt`
  6. Specialist call (Anthropic, higher max_tokens)
  7. Returns `{ body: { classification, translation }, metadata }` where metadata is the typed log fields
- `app/api/translate/route.ts` — Edge runtime thin handler. Auth → rate-limit → pipeline → JSON response. Logs only the typed metadata (classification_label, classification_confidence, specialist_route, total_input_tokens, total_output_tokens, call_count, response_status, latency_ms). Errors logged with error_code + upstream only
- `tests/canary/translate.test.ts` — mocks auth/ratelimit/`callAnthropicJson`. Sends tracer in `ocr_text` AND embeds it in the mocked specialist translation. Asserts: response contains tracer (correctness); no proxyLogger payload string contains the tracer (privacy); stdout/stderr clean. Also covers invalid-JSON-body (400) and rate-limited (429) error paths
- `tests/unit/route.test.ts` — routing logic: each category picks the right specialist, low classifier confidence falls back to generic, threshold-boundary behavior, all 5 prompts include the JSON-only OUTPUT directive
- `tests/unit/anthropic-client.test.ts` — `callAnthropicMessages`: happy path + 429 + 500 + missing key. `callAnthropicJson`: valid JSON first try, code-fence stripping, retry-on-parse-failure success path, two-failures → UPSTREAM_INVALID_RESPONSE
- 37/37 tests passing across 7 files, lint clean, TS clean, build succeeds with `/api/translate` registered as a function route
- **Deferred to Day 6:** quality-check pass (`buildPrompt_QualityCheck`), the 20-letter synthetic corpus tone review, and the OCR threshold tuning carried over from Day 4

### Day 6 — Quality check + smoke harness

- `lib/prompts/quality-check.ts` — `buildPrompt_QualityCheck(ocrText, translation)`. The third pipeline call. System prompt instructs the model to check the four critical faithfulness dimensions: amount integrity, date integrity, deadline preservation, no hallucinations. Explicitly allows MASKED account numbers (bank specialist's last-4-digits-plus-bullets convention) as NOT a violation. Output shape: `{ passes: boolean, concerns: string[], confidence: number }`. Temperature 0
- `lib/prompts/types.ts` — added `QualityCheckResult` interface, added `quality_check` field to `TranslateResponse`
- `lib/proxy/translate-pipeline.ts` — wired QC as step 3 (now 3 LLM calls per request). `runQualityCheckSafely` catches upstream/parse failures and returns a "couldn't validate" verdict (`passes: false`, `concerns: ["quality check could not run"]`, `confidence: 0`) — we don't fail the user's request when only QC errors. `normalizeQualityCheck` defensively normalizes the model's JSON in case of malformed shape. `PipelineMetadata` extended with `quality_check_passed` (was already in the LoggableField union from Day 3)
- `app/api/translate/route.ts` — logs `quality_check_passed` alongside the existing metadata
- `tests/canary/translate.test.ts` — mock now handles all three calls (routed by `max_tokens`: 512 = classify, 1024 = QC, 4096 = specialist). Asserts `quality_check.passes` flows into the response
- `tests/unit/quality-check.test.ts` — asserts the prompt includes both the OCR and the translation, instructs the model on each of the three mangled-case categories (amounts, deadlines, hallucinations), allows MASKED account numbers, enforces JSON-only output, uses temperature 0
- `tests/unit/translate-pipeline.test.ts` — six integration cases at the `callAnthropicJson` seam: happy path (QC passes); three mangled cases where the mocked QC returns `passes: false` with category-specific concerns (wrong amount, missing deadline, hallucinated fact) — the DoD's three deliberately-mangled cases; QC upstream error → "couldn't validate" verdict but request still succeeds; QC malformed shape → normalized to a failed verdict
- `scripts/smoke-translate.ts` (+ `pnpm smoke:translate` script) — runs the full classify → route → specialist → QC chain against a real OCR text and prints structured output, latency, token usage, and approximate USD cost (computed from Anthropic Sonnet rates: $3/$15 per 1M input/output tokens). Reusable for the Day 6 tone-review work and for any future "did Day X regress the pipeline?" check. Reads `.env.local` directly so the user can run it from the main project folder
- 51/51 tests passing across 9 files, lint clean, TS clean, build clean
- **Deferred (still):** the manual 20-letter tone review and the OCR threshold tuning. Both require real letter texts and human judgment — the tools (`smoke:translate`, `smoke:ocr`) are in place; the human-in-the-loop step hasn't been done

### Day 7 — Upload UI (file picker + camera, end-to-end on /dashboard)

Built the full upload-to-result flow on the existing `/dashboard` route. Day 8 was originally planned to add a richer results card — but since Day 7 already needs to display something after translation, the dashboard now renders the full structured result (tldr / classification / action items / amounts / dates / references / Hebrew + English full translation / collapsible OCR text). Day 8 can refine this further (deadline countdowns, Hebrew/English toggle on results, polish) but the functional pipeline is shippable today.

- `messages/{en,he}.json` — `Upload` namespace added: title, intro, file-picker labels, status messages (ocrInProgress / translateInProgress), error strings (errorTooLarge / errorUnsupportedType / errorGeneric / errorRateLimited / errorAuth), results labels, privacy reminder
- `app/[locale]/dashboard/upload-form.tsx` — client component. State machine: `idle` → `ocr` → `translate` → `done` (or `error`). Holds the selected `File`, an object-URL preview, and the eventual `TranslateResponse`. Reads `supabase.auth.getSession().access_token` and passes `Authorization: Bearer <token>` to both API calls. File picker accepts `image/jpeg|png|webp|gif` (matches `lib/proxy/ocr-client.ts#normalizeMediaType` allow-list), `capture="environment"` triggers the native rear-camera on iOS Safari and Android Chrome. Client-side preflight on size (10 MB) and MIME type so we don't waste an OCR call on an obviously-bad upload. Status mapping: 429 → errorRateLimited, 401 → errorAuth, anything else → errorGeneric (specific error_code from the proxy is intentionally not shown to the user — by design, we expose less surface). Spinner + accessible aria-hidden SVG
- `app/[locale]/dashboard/upload-form.tsx#ResultsView` — the structured display. Quality-check banner at the top (green if `quality_check.passes`, yellow with concerns otherwise — directly implementing the spec's "we're not confident in this translation" surface). Sections rendered conditionally based on whether the field is non-empty. Action items color-coded by urgency (red / yellow / gray). Reference numbers in monospace. Original OCR text behind a "Show original" toggle. The "Translate another letter" button resets state and revokes the preview object URL
- `app/[locale]/dashboard/page.tsx` — kept the existing server-side auth chain (no session → /sign-in; no profile → /not-invited; no consent → /onboarding); replaced the placeholder block with `<UploadForm />`. Mobile-first padding (`p-4 sm:p-8`)
- All 51 existing tests still pass. Lint clean. TS clean. `pnpm build` registers `/dashboard` and confirms no Edge-runtime regressions from the new client component
- **Not yet exercised in real-device testing:** the DoD says "on a phone, take a photo of a letter and see it queued for translation. Test iOS Safari and Android Chrome." That's a manual phone test you'll want to do post-merge once the Vercel preview is deployed

## 7. What's left — Days 8-10

The current build plan is `build-plan-beta.md`. Day-by-day summary:

**Day 8 — Results UI polish.** Day 7 shipped a functional structured results display on /dashboard. Day 8 work is the additional polish from the original plan that wasn't in Day 7: deadline banner with a live countdown for `is_deadline:true` dates within the next 30 days; explicit Hebrew/English toggle on the results card (currently both shown stacked); refined visual hierarchy. Optional but high-value: a "copy this translation as text" / "share" button for messages/email.

**Day 9 — Client-side history (IndexedDB).** Schema. Auto-save on success. List page (chronological, filterable by classification). Open past translation read-only. Delete single + delete all. Export as JSON.

**Day 10 — Beta launch.** Beta-only landing page (no signup form, just "invite-only — contact us"). Privacy + subprocessors pages deployed at `/privacy` and `/subprocessors` in both languages. Invite issuance flow (insert email into `beta_invites`, system sends welcome email via Resend). Run self-review checklist from `no-log-proxy-spec.md`. Smoke test all flows in production. Send first 5 invites.

## 8. The prompts (referenced from CLAUDE.md, not yet implemented)

These prompts were designed in the strategy phase but **the prompt files do not yet exist in the codebase.** They need to be built during days 5-6. From CLAUDE.md:

- `buildPrompt_ClassifyDocument(ocrText)` — institution + purpose + urgency
- `buildPrompt_TranslateDocument(ocrText, classification)` — generic full translation (fallback if no specialist matches)
- `buildPrompt_BituachLeumi(ocrText)` — specialist: ביטוח לאומי letters
- `buildPrompt_BankLetter(ocrText)` — specialist: bank letters
- `buildPrompt_MunicipalityLetter(ocrText)` — specialist: municipality letters
- `buildPrompt_LawyerLetter(ocrText)` — specialist: legal notices
- `buildPrompt_QualityCheck(ocrText, translationResult)` — validate before showing user
- `routeToSpecialistPrompt(ocrText, classification)` — routing logic

All prompts return JSON. The system prompt must end with: `"OUTPUT: Respond ONLY with valid JSON. No preamble, no markdown fences."` Parse with try/catch + retry on parse failure.

Cost target per document: ~$0.006-0.011 (3 calls × Claude Sonnet rates).

## 9. Open items / decisions to make

- **Daily token budget** (`DAILY_TOKEN_BUDGET` env var). Currently a placeholder. Tune from first week of real traffic.
- **External security reviewer** for graduation to public launch. Recommended: Cobalt.io at ~$5-7K, 1-2 week engagement. Book this when budget allows.
- **Israeli company registration** — required for Stripe IL at public launch. 2-3 week process, ~$1,500-2,500. Start this 3-4 weeks before public launch target date.
- **Welcome email template.** Resend is wired up but the actual email content (HTML + text) hasn't been drafted. Day 10 work.
- **What happens after a translation?** UX question: do we let users save/share/export individual translations? IndexedDB stores them locally, but the Day 8 Results UI design hasn't been fully nailed down. Look at CLAUDE.md's description of "deadline banner, summary card, action checklist" for the seed of an answer.

## 11. Important non-obvious things

**The no-log discipline is the entire point.** The product's privacy promise is "we don't store your letter, we don't log it, we don't keep a copy." Every line of code in `lib/proxy/` and `app/api/{ocr,translate}/` exists to make that promise *technically* true. The custom ESLint rules and the CI canary test enforce it. Read `no-log-proxy-spec.md` Section "The Six Disciplines" before touching any proxy code.

**`/api/translate` is the only route allowed to parse a request body.** Per the spec, the OCR route streams its body through to Google Vision without ever calling `request.text()` or `request.json()`. The translate route is an explicit exception because it has to orchestrate 3 sequential LLM calls and needs to read the OCR text. This is documented in the spec.

**The CI canary test is the single most important test.** On every PR it submits a request with a unique `__TRACER_<uuid>__` string, mocks the upstream, then scans all logs/Sentry/stdout for that string. Fails the build if found anywhere. This catches accidental logging regressions that bypass ESLint.

**The `handle_new_user` trigger is the security boundary for invite-only.** When Google OAuth or magic link successfully authenticates, the user *exists* in `auth.users` but only gets a `profiles` row if their email matches `beta_invites`. The app uses "profile exists" as the proxy for "is invited". A user without a profile gets bounced to `/not-invited`. Don't move this logic to application code without thinking very carefully about race conditions.

**Beta consent capture is the legal foundation.** `BETA_CONSENT_VERSION` (env var, currently `"1.0"`) is recorded on the profile alongside the timestamp when the user accepts. If the consent text ever changes (e.g., new beta terms), bump the version, and have a server action that prompts users to re-consent the next time they sign in (compare profile's version to env var). This isn't implemented yet but is a hook for later.

**The privacy policy is the contract.** The promises in `privacy-en.md` / `privacy-he.md` are what we sell. Every architectural decision must uphold them. If a new feature would require breaking a promise, the policy needs to change first (with 14-day user notice), not the architecture quietly drifting.

**Hebrew RTL is not just CSS.** Right-to-left affects layout, icon directions, list bullet positions, and text alignment. Test in Hebrew, not just English. The locale-aware layout in `app/[locale]/layout.tsx` sets `dir="rtl"` for Hebrew; check this is respected in every new UI component.

## 12. Working with Avraham

- **Style:** prefers thoughtful explanations and trade-offs over confident assertions. Asks substantive follow-up questions. Will push back if something doesn't sit right with him — listen carefully, his pushback has been consistently well-reasoned.
- **Trust signals he values:** honest about limitations (e.g., "this isn't audited yet"), explicit about costs, transparent about what's deferred vs done.
- **What he doesn't want:** marketing-speak that's technically true but creates misleading impressions; cost surprises; corner-cutting on PII.
- **What he does want:** momentum. He explicitly said "I'd like to see how much can Claude Code actually do with full permissions." Don't bottleneck on his approval for every small decision — make reasonable calls, document them, and flag the big ones for his input.
- **Communication:** prefers Hebrew slang and Israeli directness over US-style hedging. "Tachles, what's left?" is a normal question.

## 13. Next session priorities (Day 8)

When the next session starts:

1. Read this handoff document.
2. **Real-device test the Day 7 UI before anything else.** Open the production (or Vercel preview) /dashboard on:
   - iOS Safari — take a photo via the in-page camera button, verify the preview, submit, verify the OCR+translate round-trip completes, verify the results card renders RTL correctly
   - Android Chrome — same flow
   - Desktop — file picker path
   - If any of those break, fix before Day 8 polish work
3. **Three carryovers from previous days, still pending:**
   - **OCR threshold tuning (Day 4):** 20 anonymized letters → `pnpm smoke:ocr` → tune `OCR_FALLBACK_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD`. Avraham flagged this for "next week" — should ideally land before Day 10 invites
   - **Translate tone review (Day 5/6):** 5 letters per specialist via `pnpm smoke:translate`. Read each output; tune prompts if tone drifts from "friend explaining over coffee". Same deadline
   - **Day 7 mobile-device DoD:** see step 2 above
4. Build Day 8 polish per `build-plan-beta.md`:
   - **Deadline banner with live countdown** at the top of the results when any `dates[].is_deadline === true` and the date is within 30 days. Computed client-side from the rendered date string. Format: "Deadline in 4 days — appeal Bituach Leumi decision". Red/yellow color based on urgency
   - **Hebrew/English toggle** on the results card (currently both stacked). User picks one as primary; the other is collapsible. Default to user's locale
   - **Refined visual hierarchy** — bigger TL;DR, sectioned action items with checkboxes (visual only — not persistent yet, history is Day 9), better spacing on mobile
   - Optional but high-value: a "share / copy as text" button that builds a clipboard-friendly plain-text summary of the translation
   - Confidence indicator on the results card — currently shown as a small percentage; could be a more readable badge ("Sicher" / "Likely" / "Uncertain") based on quality_check.confidence + classification.confidence
5. Commit + push + open PR. Merge after Vercel green.
6. Update this handoff document if any decisions changed during day 8.

Useful commands wired so far:
- `pnpm lint` — ESLint with the three proxy rules
- `pnpm test:canary` — tracer harness against /api/ocr and /api/translate
- `pnpm test:unit` — unit tests (stream, ocr-client, route, anthropic-client, quality-check, translate-pipeline)
- `pnpm test` — all vitest tests (51 currently)
- `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` — TypeScript check
- `pnpm build` — Next build (run before push to catch Edge-runtime issues)
- `pnpm smoke:ocr <path-to-image>` — direct OCR provider smoke test
- `pnpm smoke:translate <path-to-text-file>` — full classify→specialist→QC chain with cost report
- `node scripts/check-proxy-disk-writes.mjs <files>` — manual pre-commit scan

**Recurring Edge-runtime gotcha:** Vercel's Edge function scanner rejects ANY package in the import graph that uses `node:fs` / `node:path` / `node:crypto` (for some hash algorithms) — even if the offending code path is unreachable at runtime. When adding a new dependency to anything imported by a route under `/api/`, verify locally with `pnpm build` and watch for "Edge Function ... is referencing unsupported modules". The Day 4 followups burned several iterations on this with `@anthropic-ai/sdk` (which we replaced with direct `fetch()`). Default to fetch + REST for any Anthropic/Google/Supabase service called from Edge routes.

If something feels wrong while building, stop and ask Avraham rather than guess. The privacy architecture is too important to "I think this is what they meant" through.

## 14. How to talk to the next user message

The next message after this handoff will probably be Avraham continuing the project in Claude Code. Don't re-explain everything from this document at the start — assume he's read it (or pointed Claude Code at it). Jump straight into the work, asking clarifying questions where genuinely needed.
